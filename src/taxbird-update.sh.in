Pleased to meet you!

This is taxbird-update.sh \$Revision: 1.4 $,
your fully automatic taxbird updater...

I see, you don't have CVS installed.
This is kinda bad, since it's necessary for doing the update.

Sorry.

### say goodbye ...
cat <<__FOO

Congratulations! 
I was able to successfully update your Taxbird installation.

Please run this script regularly, especially since Taxbird is
currently somewhat in alpha-alike or maybe beta stage, and
bugs are expected to be there.

Furthermore please mind that this script only updates sheet
descriptions etc. (the stuff written in guile scripting language).
It does NOT update the (binary) application itself, therefore if
there is a new taxbird or libgeier release you should manually
install this one as well.

Thank you for using taxbird!
