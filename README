(probably) Frequently Asked Questions
========================================
F: When running taxbird I sometimes get 
   "WARNING **: Invalid UTF8 string passed to pango_layout_set_text()".
   Why is this?

A: taxbird expects the Scheme sources to be encoded in UTF-8. No filtering
   etc. is done to the read strings, i.e. they are passed on to Gnome/Pango.
   If you encode your file with ISO-8859-1 for example, pango will not be able
   to interpret the data and will emit the warning. The shown strings will be
   truncated at the first non-ASCII character in this case.
